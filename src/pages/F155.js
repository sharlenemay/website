      An Analysis of Female Identity and Nationalism in <italic>Dekada ‘70</italic>
      </h3>
      <p>
      Dekada ’70, a historical fiction film, thoroughly outlines the years of Martial Law in the Philippines.  This time period, as stated by Sison (2016), represented a time of “military repression and wholesale human rights violations” under the dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos (Sison, “Dekada 70”).  Directed by Chito S. Roño and based on the 1983 novel by Lualhati Bautista, it tells the story of the fictional middle-class Bartolome family and their life during Martial Law in the Philippines.  The plot follows real-life events from the beginning of pre-Martial Law during the 1960s until the end of the Marcos regime in 1986 and particularly focuses on the female lead and wife/mother character Amanda Bartolome, played by Vilma Santos, and her experience and struggles as a woman in late 1900s Philippine society.  While also conveying elements of Philippine culture throughout the movie, the 2002 film Dekada ’70 well depicts the position and role of mothers in Philippine society through Amanda’s character.   Amanda is the mother of five sons and wife of Julian Bartolome, played by Christopher de Leon, an alpha-male husband that suppresses his wife with harsh words and restricts her from pursuing her own goals outside of the home.  Meanwhile, their sons, Jules (Piolo Pascual), Gani (Carlos Agassi), Em (Marvin Agustin), Jason (Danilo Barrios), and Bingo (John Wayne Sace) pursue their own interests in romance and nationalism as the consequences of Martial Law affect their interpersonal young adult lives.  Through the development of Amanda’s character and her relations with her husband and sons, alongside underscoring the theme of nationalism and identity, the ingrained value of mothers in Philippine society retains the idea of women empowerment with a family-oriented ideal which is portrayed through film.

      The story focuses on a central theme of national identity and the intended audience may be the Philippine society in the early 2000s.  Before each time transition, the years are indicated before the scenes for the viewers to grasp an accurate time frame.  Without these clear indications of time, it would be difficult to interpret and follow along with the time progression.  From the beginning, opening scenes provided the background and context to the events that were to unfold.  The patriarchal society is portrayed immediately in the Bartolome household at the dinner table when Julian gives a lecture to his sons about “A Man’s World” and tells how women are expected to be obedient and wait for the men to tell them what to do.  This gender differentiation is further underscored when Julian refuses to let Amanda work outside of the house, claiming that he should be deemed as the only “bread-winner” despite their financial instability.  From these scenes, the viewers can already gain a sense of the past society that, although somewhat developed since then, represented and may continue to represent the post-colonial idea of women’s degraded status in society.  After these seemingly calm scenes with the family members and light talk of politics among the adults, the tension rises and a political shift occurs with the burning of the Marcos effigy and short appearance of Uncle Sam, the indication of American influence and involvement in society.

      The scenes might have been carefully chosen to accurately construct a relatable image of the characters.  When Jules and his close friend Willy (Jhong Hillario) take pledges to join the resistance, the context transitions into a new period of social unrest in the few years prior to Martial Law.  By including actual scenes from the events such as the 1971 protest at the University of the Philippines after the election of Ferdinand Marcos, strong emotions of nationalism may spark within the viewers with or without much knowledge of the event.  Long shots of the entire protest incorporated with medium shots of Jules and Willy allow for fiction to intertwine with fact as if the characters were real and alive during this time.

      Creative elements of mis-en-scene, such as the clothing and distinct late 90’s hairstyles shown on the actors, background music, and props including old radios and television appliances in the film, supported the overall setting and time period of the story.  Although the film was released in 2002, the cinematography and overall presentation of the characters contributed to the authenticity of representing such a critical time period in Philippine history in a way that the majority of the audience, including those who were born post-Martial Law, will be able to understand and sympathize with the feelings of the Bartolome family.  Moreover, the film was able to successfully highlight the brutal and inhumane realities of Martial Law with grotesque and graphic imagery.  Many civilians and activists were tortured and killed during this violent era and the torture scenes of the characters, specifically that of Willy and Jules.  From the uncensored visuals of violence, members of the audience, especially those that experienced Martial Law personally, may feel immense feelings of sadness after becoming attached to these fictional but relatable characters.  Another emotional part of the story is when the news of Jason’s death is brought to Julian and Amanda.  Julian, already shown to be an aggressive man, physically releases his overwhelming sadness and Amanda resonates with the true emotion and heartbreak of a mother upon hearing the death of her son.  Amanda faints and is later overcome with tears at the funeral service.  From this point on, Amanda gradually becomes more transparent with her emotions and her resilient character is directly revealed when she speaks up against her husband, claiming that she no longer needs approval from Julian and wants to be proud of herself.

      By following the discourses and actions of the male characters (the father and sons), the female lead role (the mother) may be underscored.  As stated by Libed (2010), “In both public and private spheres, a common belief amongst Filipinos is that a woman and her womanhood are contingent upon her traditional roles as wife and mother” (Libid, Dekada ’70 and activist mothers).  While the story revolves around the lives of the Bartolome boys and men, initially, Amanda’s personal goal and aspirations are not seen clearly and the story mainly concerns her with the upbringing and taking care of her sons.  However, as the events unfold and the personal sphere of the Bartolome family becomes intertwined with the political sphere, Amanda’s character dynamically develops from being the timid and subservient wife of the 60s to being the outspoken and resilient mother of the 80s.  Her resilience is evident through her support of the other family members amongst the “chaos of conflict” happening during Martial Law (Libed, Dekadao ’70 and activist mothers).

      Lualhati Bautista, well-known for her contemporary novels that illustrate strong female leads, was able to artfully craft the female lead in Dekada ’70 as someone who the Philippine female majority may be able to identify with.  Under a patriarchal society greatly influenced by the Western World, a woman’s role in the public sphere has often been subjugated to being the counterpart of a man, whether as a wife or as a mother and such instances as aforementioned have shown prevalence in films.  Published during the final years of the Marcos regime, in 1983, there is no doubt that the readers’ feelings freshly resonated with those of the novel’s characters as the struggles of the fictional characters may have been seen as relatable to those who had actually been experiencing the realities of the political injustices.  Even for those who were not living during the regime, the same idea of Philippine nationalism and identity remained relevant decades after the publication when the film version was made, reaching a broader audience of both men and women on a personal level.

      There is no doubt that in this modern day and age, many women can still relate to Amanda and the oppression they may continue to experience either through family or work life.  Although Amanda is a fictional character, Libed (2010) highlights real women that have exemplified Amanda’s strong persona and willingness to go against the government and overcome gendered stratification.  For example, women from Cordillera protested against the government construction of the Chico River Dam in 1981 by creating a topless “human barricade” (Libed, Dekada ’70 and activist mothers).  Rather than women merely being seen as wives of mothers within the domestic realm, Amanda represents the large groups of women whose love for their country may be as resilient as their love for their families.

      I would claim that the filmmakers of Dekada ’70 were very successful in paying tribute to a crucial and devastating period in Philippine history through film while also incorporating Philippine societal and cultural aspects with a specific focus on the role of the mother.  Philippine society, with its high poverty rate and controversial political structure, has a tendency for its media and entertainment industry to center on familial values.  Dekada ’70 served as a prime example of the importance of family especially during a historical time of sociopolitical terror.  In ways, this portrayal of the Bartolome family, from the perspective of Amanda, may be seen as a parallel to the struggles and hardships of lower-middle-class families in the Philippines today.  Decades after Martial Law, the Philippines struggles to secure a stable administration and resist government corruption.  Moreover, alongside the political uncertainty, there is a lacking sense of nationalism and unity shared between the regions and 7,000 islands after centuries of colonial rule.  Overall, Dekada ’70 reached out to the individuals that make up Philippine society in efforts to unify the nation through the depiction of a woman’s perseverance and love for her family and country.
